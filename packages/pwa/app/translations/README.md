Most of the files in this folder are generated by `react-intl` **CLI tool**:
- `pwa/app/translations/en.json` <- output of _extracting_ the default messages, which you can send to your translators
- `pwa/app/translations/[locale].json` <- these are the files that your translators made for the other locales
- `pwa/app/translations/compiled/[locale].json` <- output of _compiling_ the messages into AST format
  - Compiling helps improve the performance because it allows `react-intl` to skip the parsing step

Several **npm scripts** are available to you that make it easier to use this CLI tool. See `pwa/package.json` for more details.

- To **extract the default messages** in your app, run `npm run extract-messages` to have all of the default English messages extracted into their own json file.
- To **compile the messages** from all of the locales, run `npm run compile-messages`.
